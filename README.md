# image-classification-cifar10-keras
Initiation project on artificial intelligence applied to computer vision.
The goal is to translate the structure of a neural network initially implemented under cuda-convnet for use under Keras.
We achieved ~75% accuracy.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.7 version 64-Bit Graphical Installer https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Installing

### Python requirements
Once Anaconda is installed you can download the requirements for this project using the Anaconda Navigator  

Example for tensorflow-gpu :

You'll need to do the same for the following packages :   
```
numpy  
opencv  
matplotlib  
tensorflow  
keras  
```

If you have an Nvidia gpu which support CUDA :  
```
tensorflow-gpu  
keras-gpu  
```

## Running
```
python main.py
```
You can open the terminal from the Anaconda Navigator :
